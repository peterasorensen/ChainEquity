What is a cap table?
A cap table (capitalization table) is a document detailing a company’s equity ownership structure. It lists all the shareholders in a company, the number of shares they own, and the types of securities issued to each equity holder. A cap table also provides valuable insights into a company’s finances and is a necessary tool for managing equity, understanding ownership dilution, and planning for future fundraising rounds.

At its core, a cap table is used to tell founders, investors, and executives who owns how much of a company and to track changes in ownership over time. Maintaining an accurate cap table is especially important for startups and high-growth companies where ownership percentages can change dramatically following funding rounds, employee option pool creation, and secondary transactions. Cap tables also play a major role in due diligence for potential investors who are considering investing in your startup.

The structure of a cap table
A cap table’s structure can vary depending on the size and stage of the company. As a company matures, its cap table evolves from a simple record of founders’ shares into a complex document detailing funding rounds, employee equity plans, and convertible instruments. Regardless of its structure, a cap table should be a clear, comprehensive, and accurate record of who owns what portion of the company and under what terms.

Key components
A cap table is organized into categories that detail ownership details, transaction history, and other financial information. Common components of a cap table include:

Ownership details
Ownership details are the foundation of a cap table. This section outlines who owns all types of equity in the company (including shares, options, warrants, and convertibles), the total ownership stake, and what percentage of the company that stake represents.

Shareholder information: Shareholder names, entities, and roles like founders, investors, employees, and advisors.

Number of shares: Total shares owned by each shareholder.

Ownership percentage: The percentage of the company owned.

Types of equity
This section outlines the different types of equity issued by the company, and the terms of each.

Common stock: Basic ownership shares typically issued to founders and early employees.

Preferred stock: Issued to investors during funding rounds that include voting rights, liquidation preferences, and distribution priority.

Stock options: Allows the holder the right to buy shares at a set strike price.

Warrants: Similar to stock options, but usually granted to investors or lenders as incentives.

Convertible instruments (convertible securities): Convertible notes or SAFEs (Simple Agreements for Future Equity), which are investments that convert into equity at a later date.

Share classes
Share class groups shares based on voting rights, liquidation rights, and other characteristics. Share class distinctions—common vs. preferred—help show shareholder privileges and the company’s equity structure.

You may see labels like “Class A” or “Class B” for common stock. This is not a share class distinction between preferred vs. common (both classes are common stock). Preferred stock is usually divided into series (for example: Series Seed Preferred Stock, Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, etc.).

Transaction history
The transaction history tracks all equity-related events in the company’s lifecycle, providing a detailed record of ownership and equity changes to the cap table. This includes:

Funding rounds: Details of each fundraising event, including pre-money and post-money valuations, new shares issued, and total investment amounts from each investor.

Stock or option grants: Shares allocated to employees, advisors, or other service providers.

Exercises: Purchases of shares through options, warrants, or other instruments.

Secondary transactions: Transfers or sales of existing shares to another holder.

Valuations
Valuation metrics show your shareholders how their equity translates into monetary value. These are some of the types of valuations you might include in your cap table:

Pre-money valuation: The value of the company before a new funding round.

Post-money valuation: The value of the company after the funding round.

409A valuation: This is an independent appraisal of a private company’s fair market value (FMV). The 409A value is used to set the strike price for employee stock options.

Price-per-share: The value of each preferred share sold in the funding round (share price), which is calculated using the valuation divided by the total number of fully-diluted shares. It is important to note that the valuation of the latest preferred share class does not necessarily imply that common shares have the same FMV.

Dilution analysis
Dilution analysis helps show your existing shareholders how issuing new shares or securities impacts their ownership percentages. Most often, dilution analysis will include share dilution analysis under different scenarios, like new fundraising rounds or secondary sales. Note that secondary sales only impact new equity issuances and do not impact the dilution of your overall cap table.

Exit scenarios
Exit scenarios model outcomes for shareholders in liquidity events like acquisitions or initial public offerings (IPOs). This section of your cap table models payout distributions based on ownership, share classes, and liquidation preferences.

Common formats
Choosing the right format for a cap table depends on your company’s needs. Early-stage startups often use simple Excel spreadsheets or tables to track ownership, which are cost-effective and sufficient for straightforward ownership structures.

However, as your company grows, raises new funding rounds, creates an employee stock option pool, and adds new share classes, a cap table software solution is usually needed to remain up-to-date, reduce errors, and enable scenario modeling.

Even early-stage companies with simple ownership structures can benefit from creating their cap table on a dedicated software from the beginning. Carta offers free cap table software for startups with under 25 stakeholders and less than $1 million raised.

How to create a cap table
Creating a cap table involves compiling and organizing your existing equity ownership information into a structured format that is easy to understand and maintain. There are multiple ways to create and manage a cap table, but the best option for you depends on your company’s stage and ownership structure.

The initial setup
The first step in creating your cap table is to collect all current equity and ownership information to create a complete and up-to-date picture of your company’s ownership structure. Any missing or inaccurate information can lead to complications down the line during fundraising or audits.

Here’s what you’ll need to get started:

Total authorized shares: The maximum amount of shares the company can issue

Issued and outstanding equity (stock, shares, convertibles): The amount of shares currently allocated to stakeholders

Shareholder details: Names, roles, and contributions of all equity holders

Equity types: Details of issued securities including common and preferred stock, stock options, warrants, and convertible notes

Funding rounds: Details of previous financing rounds, including valuations, total amount raised, and share price

Option pool allocation: This includes the number of shares reserved for employee equity plans, issued and outstanding shares, exercised stock options, and more

Any relevant documentation including incorporation documents will streamline this process.

Add founders’ equity
Founders’ shares reflect the initial equity split between the company’s co-founders. Documenting the initial co-founder equity split establishes ownership percentages and helps track dilution over time. To add founders’ equity, record the number of common shares assigned to each founder based on agreed ownership split, and include a column for any applicable vesting schedules.

Add investor equity
If your company has raised funds, the investor equity section will record the total investment amount, the total number of shares purchased by investors (or convertible notes or SAFEs), the price-per-share, the share class of the equity, and the voting rights and liquidation preferences agreed to with their equity. This section provides a clear record of fundraising, financial history, and company valuation.

Add an option pool
An option pool is a block of shares you set aside for equity compensation to employees and other service providers. By including an option pool in your cap table, you ensure you have shares available to incentivize employees, consultants and advisors and have more certainty about future dilution. For this step, you will need to size your option pool to be big enough to grant equity to new hires. You’ll also want to size your pool to allow for refresh grants for high performers. Other details include granted options and allocated shares.

Cap table management best practices
Whether your business is an early-stage startup or a mature organization, regular cap table management helps you avoid costly errors, remain in compliance with regulations, and build trust with your stakeholders. Below are a few best practices for cap table management to get ahead of these potential issues.

Maintain accurate records
Errors and omissions can lead to delays in fundraising, regulatory penalties, and disputes between stakeholders.

Regularly verify share ownership, equity types, and transaction history.

Reconcile cap table data with term sheets, stock certificates, and board resolutions.

Include all equity and convertible debt instruments in your cap table.

Use an organized format
An organized cap table is easier to share with stakeholders, potential investors, and lawyers and prevents misunderstandings.

Use consistent layouts and labels on columns and rows.

Differentiate between share classes and associated rights or preferences.

Update your cap table regularly
A cap table is a dynamic, living document that changes frequently. Failing to update it regularly will lead to issues during due diligence and fundraising.

Record new issuances, grants, and transfers immediately after they occur.

Show changes in ownership percentage and share dilution after a funding round.

Review and update quarterly.

Plan for dilution
Failing to account for dilution can cause issues with stakeholders.

Model dilution scenarios when preparing to issue new shares during fundraising.

Communicate the impact of dilution to stakeholders.

Size your option pool appropriately to avoid frequent dilutive increases in the future.

Use cap table management software
Cap table software reduces errors and grows with your business.

View, track, and issue equity directly to stakeholders.

Scale with streamlined workflows for fundraising, issuing securities, and managing equity.

Stay compliant and audit-ready with 409A valuations and GAAP/IFRS reports on-demand.

## How Blockchain Improves Traditional Cap Tables

### ChainEquity Implementation

This project demonstrates how blockchain technology can address many traditional cap table pain points through the ChainEquity prototype. While this is a technical demonstration and not production-ready, it showcases the potential benefits of tokenized equity management.

### Traditional Cap Table Challenges

**Manual Reconciliation**:
- Traditional: Cap tables maintained in spreadsheets, requiring manual updates after every transaction
- Error-prone: Human data entry mistakes, version control issues, conflicting records
- Slow: Updates can take days or weeks to reconcile across stakeholders

**Limited Transparency**:
- Traditional: Only company and transfer agent have full visibility
- Opacity: Shareholders may not know current ownership percentages in real-time
- Trust: Requires trusting intermediaries for accurate record-keeping

**Slow Settlement**:
- Traditional: T+2 or longer settlement for secondary transactions
- Friction: Multiple intermediaries (transfer agents, lawyers, banks)
- Cost: High transaction fees for each transfer

**Complex Corporate Actions**:
- Traditional: Stock splits require manual updates to every shareholder record
- Time-consuming: Can take weeks to process and verify
- Expensive: Legal and administrative costs scale with shareholder count

### Blockchain-Based Improvements (ChainEquity)

**Automated Record-Keeping**:
- On-chain: All ownership recorded directly on blockchain (Polygon Amoy)
- Real-time: Balances update instantly with each transaction
- Immutable: Complete audit trail of all ownership changes
- Single Source of Truth: No reconciliation needed between different systems

**Implementation Details**:
```solidity
// GatedToken.sol - ERC-20 token with allowlist
mapping(address => uint256) private _balances;
uint256 private _totalSupply;

// Every transfer updates state atomically
function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) public {
    _balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
    _balances[to] += amount;
    emit Transfer(msg.sender, to, amount);
}
```

**Transparent Ownership**:
- Public: Anyone can query current balances and ownership percentages
- Verifiable: All transactions cryptographically signed and recorded
- Historical: Query ownership at any past block height
- Trust-minimized: No reliance on central administrator for truth

**Implementation Details**:
```typescript
// Cap table generation from blockchain events
const capTable = await client.readContract({
  address: tokenAddress,
  abi: tokenAbi,
  functionName: 'balanceOf',
  args: [holderAddress]
});

// Historical queries
const historicalBalance = await client.readContract({
  address: tokenAddress,
  abi: tokenAbi,
  functionName: 'balanceOf',
  args: [holderAddress],
  blockNumber: pastBlock
});
```

**Instant Settlement**:
- Immediate: Transfers settle in ~2 seconds (Polygon block time)
- Atomic: Transaction either succeeds completely or fails, no partial states
- Cheap: ~$0.001 per transfer vs $50+ traditional wire transfer
- 24/7: No business hours, weekends, or holidays

**Comparison**:
| Metric | Traditional | ChainEquity |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| Settlement Time | T+2 (2+ days) | ~2 seconds |
| Transaction Cost | $50-500 | $0.001 |
| Availability | Business hours | 24/7/365 |
| Geographic Limits | Country-specific | Global |

**Efficient Corporate Actions**:
- Scalable: Stock split costs same for 10 or 10,000 holders
- Instant: Execute and verify in single transaction
- Transparent: All shareholders see changes immediately
- Auditable: Complete record of when and why action occurred

**Implementation Details**:
```solidity
// Virtual stock split - O(1) complexity
uint256 public splitMultiplier = 1;

function executeSplit(uint256 multiplier) public onlyOwner {
    splitMultiplier *= multiplier;
    emit StockSplit(multiplier, block.timestamp);
}

function balanceOf(address account) public view returns (uint256) {
    return _balances[account] * splitMultiplier;
}
```

**Gas Cost Comparison**:
- Traditional iteration: 50k gas × holder count = 5M gas for 100 holders
- Virtual split: ~35k gas regardless of holder count
- **Savings: 99%+ at scale**

**Programmable Compliance**:
- Automated: Transfer restrictions enforced in smart contract code
- Consistent: Same rules apply to all transactions without human intervention
- Real-time: Compliance checked before transaction confirmation
- Flexible: Rules can be updated by authorized admin

**Implementation Details**:
```solidity
// Allowlist-based transfer restrictions
mapping(address => bool) public isApproved;

function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) public {
    require(isApproved[msg.sender], "Sender not approved");
    require(isApproved[to], "Receiver not approved");
    // ... transfer logic
}
```

**Always-Accurate Cap Table**:
- Generated: Cap table derived from on-chain state, not maintained separately
- Query Anytime: Generate ownership report at any block height
- Export Formats: CSV, JSON, or database integration
- No Staleness: Always reflects current blockchain state

**Implementation Details**:
```sql
-- SQLite database updated by event indexer
SELECT
  wallet_address,
  balance,
  (balance * 100.0 / total_supply) as ownership_percent
FROM balances
WHERE balance > 0
ORDER BY balance DESC;
```

### Key Benefits Summary

|---------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Update Speed** | Days to weeks | 2 seconds |
| **Accuracy** | Manual reconciliation | Mathematically guaranteed |
| **Transparency** | Opaque | Public and verifiable |
| **Cost per Transfer** | $50-500 | $0.001 |
| **Split Execution** | Weeks + high cost | 2 seconds + $0.0007 |
| **Historical Queries** | Difficult/impossible | Query any block |
| **Audit Trail** | Paper records | Immutable blockchain |
| **Compliance** | Manual checks | Automated enforcement |
| **Availability** | Business hours | 24/7/365 |

### Real-World Use Cases Enabled

1. **Frequent Secondary Trading**: Low costs enable active secondary markets for private company shares
2. **Fractional Ownership**: Tokens divisible to 18 decimals enable micro-investments
3. **Instant Fundraising**: Close funding rounds in hours instead of weeks
4. **Global Access**: Anyone with internet can participate (subject to compliance)
5. **Transparent Governance**: Token holders can vote on-chain with cryptographic verification
6. **Automated Distributions**: Dividends or buybacks programmatically distributed proportionally

### Important Limitations (Current Implementation)

ChainEquity is a **technical prototype only** and lacks:

- **No KYC/AML**: Mock allowlist, not real identity verification
- **No Regulatory Compliance**: Not compliant with SEC, FINRA, or other regulations
- **No Audit**: Smart contracts not professionally audited for security
- **Testnet Only**: Not battle-tested on mainnet with real value
- **Simple Access Control**: Single admin key, no multi-sig or governance
- **No Legal Framework**: Missing terms of service, investor agreements, etc.

### Production Requirements

Before using blockchain for real securities, would need:

1. **Regulatory Compliance**: SEC registration or exemption (Reg D, Reg A+, Reg CF)
2. **KYC/AML Integration**: Partner with identity verification provider (Onfido, Jumio)
3. **Transfer Agent**: Licensed transfer agent to manage cap table legally
4. **Legal Framework**: Proper documentation, investor agreements, disclosures
5. **Security Audit**: Professional smart contract audit (Trail of Bits, OpenZeppelin)
6. **Multi-Sig Controls**: Gnosis Safe with multiple authorized signers
7. **Insurance**: Errors and omissions, cyber liability coverage
8. **Custody Solutions**: Institutional-grade wallet custody (Fireblocks, Anchorage)
